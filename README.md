# Ultimate Rock, scissors, paper, lizard, Spock game 

Ultimate Rock, scissors, paper, lizard, Spock, is a game designed for adults and children alike, 
to help them make decisions and have fun against an opponent who makes a truly random choices.
The game is based on the classic rock, paper scissors game, but "enhanced" based on the expanded rules 
introduced by the popular "The Big Bang Theory" sitcom during episode 8 of season 2.

- __Game Result__

- When the player makes a choice, a corresponding image is shown on their side of the game board.
- Then Javascript makes a random choice for the computer player, displays a corresponding image on the computer player's side of the game board,
  and decides who the winner is.
- The winner is announced under the choice buttons, and the score of the player or the computer is updated according to who won.
- The score and the result is clear to the user, making it easy to understand who won and what the current score standings are.
